[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findnucleo_agent.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "nucleo_agent", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "nucleo_agent" with
  any of the following names:

    nucleo_agentConfig.cmake
    nucleo_agent-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "nucleo_agent" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "nucleo_agent_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "nucleo_agent" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.

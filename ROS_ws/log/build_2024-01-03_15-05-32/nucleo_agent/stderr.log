[33mCMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:24 (add_executable):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target nucleo_agent_node
  because there is a cycle in the constraint graph:

    dir 0 is [/opt/ros/humble/lib]
    dir 1 is [/ROS_ws/install/nucleo_agent/lib]
      dir 2 must precede it due to runtime library [libnucleo_agent__rosidl_typesupport_introspection_c.so]
    dir 2 is [/ROS_ws/build/nucleo_agent]
      dir 1 must precede it due to runtime library [libnucleo_agent__rosidl_typesupport_fastrtps_c.so]

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
